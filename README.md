In this project we have developed a fully functional model of detection and recognition of license plate of any vehicle using the image of that vehicle (which contains the license plate). YOLO can easily recognize and locate the position of license plate from image. The recognition of characters on that number plate is quite a challenging task. Current model uses the edge detection or OCR to recognize the character present in the license plate, but that approach is not a true machine learning approach. Thus under this project, the recognition of characters is also done using the techniques of YOLO. Hence, the purpose of this project is to design a real time license plate detector which can be used for different application.
